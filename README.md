## Introduction

This project applies supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to Airbnb rental data from NYC, aiming to uncover patterns in pricing, cancellation policies, and neighborhood dynamics. Our team collaborated on data preparation, exploratory analysis, and modeling across several domains.

### ðŸ§© My Contributions
- **Naive Bayes Classification**: I built a model to categorize rental prices into four bins: Student Budget, Below Average, Above Average, and Pricey Digs, using selected predictors. This allowed us to assess how well listing features signal pricing tiers.
- **Decision Tree Modeling**: I constructed a classification tree to predict cancellation policy ("flexible", "moderate", "strict") using features such as room type, host characteristics, and listing details. I optimized tree complexity via cross-validation and visualized the final model using `rpart.plot`.

Each model was evaluated for performance and interpretability, with attention to real-world constraints and data limitations. This report presents our findings, code, and visualization.
